## ML Model for Boston House Price Prediction
This repository contains the machine learning model developed during my ML workshop in college. The model is designed to predict house prices in Boston based on various features.

## Features
1.Uses the Boston Housing Dataset for training
2.Employs Linear Regression for prediction
3.Achieves 99% accuracy on the test set

## Installation
1.Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/bhavani1309/boston_model.git
2.Navigate to the project directory:
  cd boston_model
3.Install dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the model using the following command:
python streamrun.py

## Dataset
The model is trained on the Boston Housing Dataset, which contains information about housing prices in different Boston neighborhoods.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 99% on the test set, making it a reliable predictor for Boston house prices.
